Why they are conducting this PABT especially for Pilot branch?
The above qualities are very much necessary for a candidate before training at Air Force Academies to mould them as a successful pilot during.
\n\n
Why it is allowed to attend this only once in the life time?\n
The candidates are allowed to attend the PABT only once in their life time.\n\n
Since as per the results of various wars, it is said that a person who donâ€™t have their natural attitude, personality and ability to become a pilot cannot be trained well as a successful pilot. So only the candidates are allowed only once, to show their skill to become pilot.

        \nServices Selection Board, popularly referred to as â€˜SSB Interviewâ€™, is a Personality and Intelligence Assessment conducted specifically to analyze the potential and compatibility of candidates for commission into the Armed Forces of India as officers. The interview process, which consists of a series of scientific and time tested psychological testing techniques, is usually spread over a span of five days.\n
        \n\nThe prime aim of selection system in SSB is to conclusively explore and grade potentiality in a candidate which are required to be essential in a candidate for becoming an officer in armed forces. In order to be fair, the system consists of three different and independent techniques. Each technique grades and assesses the qualities which are essential for defence services by allowing least time and under stressful condition, which is the practical requirement for an officer during emergencies like wars. These three are as follows

\nPsychological Test: These are carried out by specially trained psychologist under a time bound system.
\n\nGTOâ€™s Tests:  These tests are carried out face to face on the ground in which the testing officer assesses the qualities based on the performance shown by candidates on ground under stress.
\n\nInterviewing Officer\'s Test:  The President or Deputy President interviews the candidate.He assesses the traits of personality of the candidate. The interviewing officer generally divides his method of interview into two parts. They are : without stress in which he puts the routine questions or questions on stated facts and thereafter under stress, In which he puts problems, situations and wants to know the solution or ability of the candidate To tackle these problems or situations.
